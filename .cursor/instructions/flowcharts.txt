Commentary:

The flowchart ensures clarity on how users transition from login to data engagement.

Developers should trigger telemetry events at each node (e.g., login success, filter applied, report generated).

The branching logic for "Filter Data?" highlights the need for optional yet accessible filters, which must not obstruct the user journey.

Support and feedback should be easily accessible from all major states—especially after data use or export.
